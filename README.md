The Parkview Packnett Family Cancer Institute provides care to cancer patients who often undergo tests that involve sequencing the DNA contained within their tumors. 

The Precision Genomics team at Parkview Health needs this genomic result data in discrete structured data fields in patient electronic medical record in Epic.
Currently, many results of genomic sequencing tests are captured in PDF documents that are scanned into patient medical records.
This creates difficulty for providers who are unable to locate these results. Moreover, automated reports cannot be run on these results because they are not captured in structured, 
discrete data fields in the medical record. 

The goal of this project is to create an application that takes a PDF digital file as an input to extract patient data, convert it into discrete data fields, and store it in a database for easy access.
Users can upload files to this program, start the data extraction process, and confirm if this data is valid with what is known. 
If the data is invalid, the user can redo the data extraction process without storing invalid data.
If the data is valid, the user can safely store the collected information in a database. 
This application will allow Parkview Health Staff to efficiently identify genomic sequences and tie these sequences to general patient information. 
This will effectively eliminate the human error and research time to manually correlate genomic sequences with their true meanings.

Our team, Jack Win, Adam Whiteman, John Bradin, Diana Karim, and Cameryn Zehner are working to fulfill these requirements as our Senior Capstone Project at PFW.
